    "2. When you're ready to run a code block, **select it by clicking on it**\n",
    "    - You will see a blue bar to the left of the current block\n",
    "    - You can edit the code in the block, but the first few blocks in this notebook won't need any changes. Just run them.\n",
    "3. To run a block, **click the ▶ button** in the bar at the top of the book\n",
    "    - <img src=\"images/play-button.png\" height=\"118px\" width=\"318px\" alt=\"Screenshot of Jupyter notebook toolbar with play button circled\">\n",

(The entire field of Artificial Intelligence is a multi-decade quest by some of the world's cleverest researchers to find a way to make machines work a little more like the human mind. Those researchers have made remarkable progress!) In the meantime, we need to tell the computers what to do in excruciating detail. This skill is programming, and Artificial Intelligence development builds on top of that skill.\n",

    "For us humans who are working with computers, the most fundamental skill is probably: **how do you break down a complex task into manageable steps**? Keep looking for ways to do this in your next project!"
